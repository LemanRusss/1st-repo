        <h1>Varieties of Cake</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and
        mixing techniques. Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy
        to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.</p>

        <h2>Butter cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Gooey butter cake Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and
        flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to
        incorporate air into the batter. A classic pound cake is made with a pound each of
        butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Another type of butter cake that takes its names from the
        proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour,
        and 4 eggs. According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the
        American pioneers who settled North Carolina. Baking powder is in many butter cakes,
        such as Victoria sponge. The ingredients are sometimes mixed without creaming the
        butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes.</p>

        <h2>Sponge cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Steamed sponge cake called ma lai gao Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from
        whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They
        rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide
        leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added.
        Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast. Angel food
        cake is a white cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a
        tube pan. The French GÃ©noise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly
        decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau, the French word for
        cake. Chiffon cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.</p>

        <h2>Chocolate cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>German chocolate cake Chocolate cakes are butter cakes,
        sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or cocoa powder. German
        chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake. Fudge cakes are chocolate cakes that contain
        fudge.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Coffee cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a coffee break.
        Some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a
        crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Flourless cake</h2> 
        <p>Baked flourless cakes include baked cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes.</p>

        <h2>Layer cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>A strawberry cake prepared as a layer cake Layer cakes are cakes made with layers of
        sponge or butter cake, filled with cream, jam or other filling to hold the layers together.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>One egg cake</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>One egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter or
        vegetable shortening. One egg cake was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each
        cake was too costly.</p>
